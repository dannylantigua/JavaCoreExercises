## Classes and Objects

In this section there are exercises for more advanced OOP concepts. These concepts include Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Composition, Inheritance, Storage and Memory Management, Collections and Maps, Data Marshalling and Unmarshalling, Tiered Application Design and MVC and Software Development Lifecycle, . The file structure is the following:

1. ClassModeling: You are given two different scenarios for which to model each of these real-world objects.  Consider the important properties and methods needed for each scenario and each model and then create a Java class for each of the following:

House
* Model a house as if the class were to be part of a GPS mapping system.
* Model a house as if the class were to be part of a 3-D design system.
Airplane
* Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of an air traffic control system.
* Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of a flight simulator.
Car
* Model a car as if the class were to be part of an inventory system for a car dealership.
* Model a car as if the class were to be part of a video game.
Ice cream
* Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the control system at the dairy that makes the ice cream.
* Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the stocking system at a grocery store.

2. Refactor Into Objects: Taking exercises from java basics and refactoring them into objects, classes and methods.
