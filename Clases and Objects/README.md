## Classes and Objects

In this section there are exercises for more advanced OOP concepts. These concepts include Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Composition, Inheritance, Storage and Memory Management, Collections and Maps, Data Marshalling and Unmarshalling, Tiered Application Design and MVC and Software Development Lifecycle, . The file structure is the following:

1. ClassModeling: You are given two different scenarios for which to model each of these real-world objects.  Consider the important properties and methods needed for each scenario and each model and then create a Java class for each of the following:

* House
    Model a house as if the class were to be part of a GPS mapping system.
    Model a house as if the class were to be part of a 3-D design system.
* Airplane
    Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of an air traffic control system.
    Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of a flight simulator.
* Car
    Model a car as if the class were to be part of an inventory system for a car dealership.
    Model a car as if the class were to be part of a video game.
* Ice cream
    Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the control system at the dairy that makes the ice cream.
    Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the stocking system at a grocery store.
* Book.
    Model a book as if the class were to be part of a publishing system that the author uses to write the book.

2. Refactor Into Objects: Taking exercises from java basics and refactoring them into objects, classes and methods.
3. SimpleCalculator: Creating a class that performs basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) and call them on the Main method/entry point.
4. Shapes and Perimeters: Implementing abstract class to get the area and perimeter of a shape.
5. UserIOClassLab: Implementing a class to read inputs and display outputs.
6. CollectionsAndMaps: StateCaptilas exercises handled in HashMaps.
7. StudentQuizScores: Handling data using Collections.
8. ClassRosterApp: Applying MVC / CRUD development.
9. AddressBook App: Another exercise applying MVC / CRUD development.
10. DVDLibrary App: Final exercise applying MVC / CRUD development.
