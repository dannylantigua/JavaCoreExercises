3. Commenting Code
4. All The Maths

#### A Beginning

How to print messages in console using Java. Output:

```
--- exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec (default-cli) @ Unit1 ---
Hello World!
Hello from the Guild!
Typing code is easier than I thought ...
Typity Typity Type!
After I finish typing,
I'll compile my code.
And then when I run it,
The console will print out all my brilliant words!
And it all starts with "Hello World!" ..
```

Files 2 and 3 (Project Gutenburg and Commenting Code) are pretty much the same.

#### All The Maths

Printing and doing some math operations. Output:

```
--- exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec (default-cli) @ Unit1 ---
1 + 2 is: 3
42001 modulus 5 is: 1
5565.0 divided by 22.0 is : 252.95454545454547
223 times 31 - 42: 6871
Is 4 greater than -1? true

****** Now make the computer do some harder maths!
8043.52 minus 4.2 plus 23.0 divided by 56.0 times -76.13 is: 8008.052321428572
11111 modulus 3 minus 67 minus 1 plus 9 is: -57
44 minus 22 minus 11 minus 66 minus 88 minus 76 minus 11 minus 33 is : -263
22 times 3 minus 1 plus 4 times 6 minus -9 is : 98
Is 67 greater than 4 * 5? true
Is 78 less than than 4 * 5? false
